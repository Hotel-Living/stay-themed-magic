‚öôÔ∏è HOTEL-LIVING GUESTS ARE NOT TRANSIENT TOURISTS  
They are respectful long-term residents who stay for 8, 16, 24, or 32 days.

üåø SMARTER GUESTS, SMARTER RESOURCE USAGE  
Thanks to longer stays and a more personal relationship with the property, these guests tend to be more mindful about resource usage.  
They feel more like temporary tenants than short-stay visitors ‚Äî and that makes a real difference.  
________________________________________  
‚ö° SERVICE USAGE IS LOWER AND MORE STABLE  
üí° ENERGY-EFFICIENT SYSTEMS (such as LED lighting and moderated climate control) become even more effective  
üå± WHEN FEELING AT HOME, guests naturally adopt more sustainable habits  
________________________________________  
üíú A SENSE OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY  
Because Hotel-Living offers accessible rates, guests are usually aware and respectful of the opportunity.  
They know this model depends on balance, care, and sustainability ‚Äî and most act accordingly.  
________________________________________  
üîÑ OPTIMIZED OPERATIONS = OPTIMIZED CONSUMPTION  
Thanks to lower room turnover and simplified cleaning protocols, the use of utilities remains steady and optimized, with fewer electricity or water usage spikes.
