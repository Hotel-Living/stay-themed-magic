    question: "How far in advance should I book my stay?",
    answer: "For popular destinations and affinities, we recommend booking 2-3 months in advance, especially during peak seasons. Some of our most exclusive properties can fill up 6 months ahead. However, we also offer last-minute availability in many locations, sometimes with special rates for immediate occupancy."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel or change my booking?",
    answer: "Yes, most bookings can be modified or cancelled. Standard stays have a 30-day cancellation policy with a full refund if cancelled outside that window. Within 30 days, a portion of your first month's payment may be retained as a cancellation fee. Flex-rate bookings offer more flexibility for a slightly higher rate. All policies are clearly indicated during the booking process."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a membership fee or subscription?",
    answer: "No, there's no mandatory membership fee. You only pay for your stays."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I select a hotel based on my favorite affinities?",
    answer: "Our advanced filtering system allows you to search for hotels based on affinities that interest you. Simply select your preferred affinity from our extensive list, and we'll show you properties that offer activities, facilities, and communities centered around that interest."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace multiple unpredictable bills with a single fixed payment?",
    answer: "Yes! One of the major benefits of our service is financial predictability. Your monthly rate typically includes all utilities, internet, housekeeping, and amenities, so you don't have to worry about unexpected bills or maintenance costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How does direct payment at the hotel work?",
    answer: "You can reserve your stay with just 10% of the total rate. The remaining balance is paid directly to the hotel upon arrival, eliminating middleman fees and giving you the opportunity to verify that everything meets your expectations before completing your payment."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book multiple hotels for consecutive stays?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many of our members create their own 'circuit' of stays across multiple properties. Our platform allows you to book consecutive stays at different properties."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer any loyalty programs or rewards?",
    answer: "Yes, our Hotel-Living Passport program rewards your stays with points that can be redeemed for discounts, upgrades, exclusive experiences, and even complimentary nights. The longer and more frequently you stay with us, the more benefits you unlock, including priority booking and special partner offers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book a stay if I'm not sure about my exact dates yet?",
    answer: "Our flexible booking option allows you to reserve a room type and approximate timeframe without committing to exact dates. You can finalize your specific check-in and check-out dates closer to your stay, usually up to 14 days before arrival, subject to availability. This is perfect for travelers with evolving plans."
