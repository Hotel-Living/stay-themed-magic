    question: "How large are the communities at each property?",
    answer: "Community sizes vary by property, but most range from 15-50 concurrent guests participating in the same affinity programs. This size is intentionally designed to be large enough for diverse interactions but small enough to foster meaningful connections. The continuous flow of new arrivals keeps communities dynamic while maintaining a core group of longer-term participants."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there community managers at the properties?",
    answer: "Yes, each property has a designated community facilitator who organizes activities, introduces new guests, facilitates connections, and ensures the affinity programming runs smoothly. These facilitators are knowledgeable about both the property's specialties and the surrounding area, serving as valuable resources for enhancing your stay."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of community events can I expect?",
    answer: "Beyond affinity-specific activities, properties typically host regular community gatherings like welcome dinners for new arrivals, social mixers, group outings to local attractions, and special celebration events. Many also organize skill-sharing sessions, discussion groups, and collaborative projects that bring guests together across different interests."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I maintain privacy while still being part of the community?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our model is designed to balance private space with community engagement. You always have your private room as a personal sanctuary, and participation in all community activities is entirely optional. Many guests appreciate being able to engage with the community when they choose while having private space to recharge."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle different personality types in community settings?",
    answer: "Our community design accommodates diverse personality types. For extroverts, we offer frequent social gatherings and communal activities. For introverts, we create comfortable spaces for smaller interactions and quieter participation. Community facilitators are trained to ensure all personality types feel welcome and that no one feels pressured to participate beyond their comfort level."
