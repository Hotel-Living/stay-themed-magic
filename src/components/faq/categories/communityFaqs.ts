    question: "How large are the communities at each property?",
    answer: "Community sizes vary by property, but most range from 15-50 concurrent guests participating in the same affinity programs. This size is intentionally designed to be large enough for diverse interactions but small enough to foster meaningful connections. The continuous flow of new arrivals keeps communities dynamic while maintaining a core group of longer-term participants."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of community events can I expect?",
    answer: "Beyond affinity-specific activities, properties typically host regular community gatherings like welcome dinners for new arrivals, social mixers, group outings to local attractions, and special celebration events. Many also organize skill-sharing sessions, discussion groups, and collaborative projects that bring guests together across different interests."

  {
    question: "Can I maintain privacy while still being part of the community?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our model is designed to balance private space with community engagement. You always have your private room as a personal sanctuary, and participation in all community activities is entirely optional. Many guests appreciate being able to engage with the community when they choose while having private space to recharge."
