    question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
    answer: "We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), PayPal, bank transfers, and in many regions, digital payment systems like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Some locations also accept cryptocurrency payments. All payments are processed securely through our encrypted platform."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a security deposit?",
    answer: "Yes, most properties require a refundable security deposit, typically equivalent to one week's stay. This is held but not charged to your payment method and is released within 7 days after checkout, assuming no damages or additional charges. Some premium properties may require higher deposits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pay monthly or must I pay for the entire stay upfront?",
    answer: "For stays longer than one month, you can choose to pay monthly. The first month is charged at booking to secure your reservation, and subsequent months are automatically charged on the same day each month. For stays of 6+ months, we offer additional payment options, including quarterly payments with modest discounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the cost comparable to living alone?",
    answer: "In many cases, yes. When you factor in all the costs of traditional living (rent/mortgage, utilities, internet, maintenance, furnishings, etc.) plus the value of included services like housekeeping, amenities, and community activities, Hotel-Living often provides excellent value. Many members find that the total cost is similar to or even less than their previous living arrangements, especially in major cities."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I generate monthly income by renting out my usual home?",
    answer: "Many of our members do exactly this! If you own a home, you can rent it out while you enjoy the Hotel-Living experience. This can help offset the cost of your hotel stays or even generate additional income."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees I should be aware of?",
    answer: "We pride ourselves on transparent pricing. The rate shown includes all standard amenities listed on the property page. Optional services (like additional housekeeping, premium activities, or special meal plans) are clearly priced. Local taxes may apply depending on the jurisdiction, and these are always displayed before booking confirmation."
