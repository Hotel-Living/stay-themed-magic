  {
    question: "CAN I REALLY LIVE IN HOTELS WITHOUT LOSING THE FEELING OF HOME?",
    answer: "Yes, and actually, many people say they feel more at home — no chores, no stress, and always someone to greet you. And with affinity hotels, you can even choose a place where others share your hobbies or lifestyle. That creates real connection."
  },
  {
    question: "ISN'T THIS JUST A TEMPORARY OPTION? WHAT IF I WANT TO STAY LONG-TERM?",
    answer: "You absolutely can. Many guests stay month after month, renewing as they wish — and some hotels even offer loyalty pricing. You're not tied to one place, but you can treat it as your home for as long as you like."
  },
  {
    question: "SO, IS HOTEL LIVING SUITABLE FOR SENIORS?",
    answer: "Absolutely. It's ideal for active retirees who are done with house chores, want to meet new people, and enjoy a worry-free lifestyle. It's not healthcare-focused—it's lifestyle-focused."
  },
  {
    question: "ISN'T THIS JUST LIKE STAYING IN A HOTEL FOR A FEW DAYS? I MEAN… CAN I REALLY LIVE THIS WAY, LIKE I WOULD IN MY OWN HOME OR EVEN A SENIOR RESIDENCE — BUT FOR LESS?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many hotels now offer long-stay packages with rates that are often cheaper than paying rent, utilities, groceries, cleaning, laundry, and all the rest. Here, you get it all — and with people around, not isolation."
  },
  {
    question: "SO, IN NOT WAY IS HOTEL-LIVING A TYPE OF RETIREMENT HOME?",
    answer: "Not at all. Hotel Living is not a nursing home or assisted living facility. It's a lifestyle choice for independent, active seniors who want freedom, comfort, and services—without the high costs or limitations of traditional retirement homes."
  },
  {
    question: "IS THIS JUST FOR RICH PEOPLE?",
    answer: "Not at all. Hotel Living was created to be accessible. The idea is to turn rooms that would otherwise stay empty into long-stay options for people like you. That's why prices are so reasonable — often similar to what you'd pay just to live on your own."
  },
  {
    question: "CAN HOTEL LIVING REALLY REPLACE TRADITIONAL SENIOR LIVING OPTIONS?",
    answer: "For many, yes. It's a flexible, more affordable, and much more enjoyable alternative. You get cleaning, laundry, food options, social spaces, and even affinityd hotels—all without losing your independence."
  },
  {
    question: "HOW IS THIS BETTER THAN A SENIOR RESIDENCE? AREN'T THOSE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME?",
    answer: "Senior residences are pretty different: often come with strict routines, limited privacy, and high monthly costs. Hotel Living gives you freedom, flexibility, and a real sense of independence — without giving up services or safety. And many times, at a much lower cost."
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT ABOUT MEALS AND CLEANING? I DON'T WANT TO COOK AND CLEAN EVERY DAY.",
    answer: "You won't have to. Most hotels include daily cleaning, fresh sheets, and on-site dining or room service options. Some even offer half-board or all-inclusive deals. No more shopping, cooking, or scrubbing."
  },
  {
    question: "BUT WHAT IF I GET BORED OR FEEL LONELY?",
    answer: "That's exactly what Hotel Living solves. You're surrounded by other guests, and many hotels have social areas, activities, and events. Plus, with affinity-focused stays, you'll meet people who share your interests."
  },
  {
    question: "BUT MAY I HAVE ACCESS TO A DOCTOR OR ANY KIND OF MEDICAL SUPPORT IF I STAY IN A HOTEL-LIVING PROPERTY?",
    answer: "Yes, many Hotel Living properties offer light medical support as an added comfort. Some hotels arrange weekly or even daily visits from a local doctor, while others provide on-call access in case of any concern. It's not a medical facility, but it gives you peace of mind—knowing there's a professional nearby if you ever need to ask a question or get a quick check-up."
  },
  {
    question: "WHY WOULD I CHOOSE A HOTEL OVER A PROPER RETIREMENT RESIDENCE?",
    answer: "Because you keep control of your lifestyle. No schedules, no institutional feel. You live like you're traveling — with service, comfort, and community — not like you're being looked after. And with affinityd hotels, you're surrounded by people who share your interests."
