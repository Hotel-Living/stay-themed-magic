    question: "What exactly are hotel affinities?",
    answer: "Affinities are specialized interest areas that define the focus and community of a hotel. They can range from activities (yoga, cooking, languages) to lifestyles (digital nomad, wellness) or special interests (art, music, literature). Think of them as the hotel's personality and purposeâ€”what makes it special beyond just rooms and services."
  },
  {
    question: "How many affinities should my hotel offer?",
    answer: "Most successful properties start with one primary affinity that aligns naturally with their location, facilities, or staff expertise. As your program develops, you might add 1-2 complementary affinities. Having too many dilutes your identity and stretches resources, while focusing on a few creates a stronger community and clearer marketing message."
  },
  {
    question: "What affinities are most popular with guests?",
    answer: "While this varies by region and property type, our platform data shows strong performance for wellness, culinary, creative arts, nature/outdoor, and digital nomad affinities. The most successful affinity isn't necessarily the most popular globally, but the one that best matches your property's authentic strengths and local environment."
  },
  {
    question: "What physical space requirements do affinities need?",
    answer: "Space needs vary by affinity type, but most can be implemented without major renovations. Multi-purpose areas that can be reconfigured for different activities are ideal. The essential elements are a dedicated community space (which could be part of an existing lounge), reliable technology, appropriate storage, and clear scheduling to maximize space utilization. Of course, it's always an option to collaborate with restaurants, halls, or any other related business."
  },
  {
    question: "Can affinities change seasonally?",
    answer: "Yes, seasonal variation works well for many properties, especially those in destinations with distinct seasons. For example, a mountain property might emphasize hiking and outdoor activities in summer, then shift to wellness and creative arts in winter. The key is maintaining some continuity in community feeling while adapting specific activities."
  },
  {
    question: "What if some regular guests don't want to participate?",
    answer: "Participation is always optional. While the affinity creates a thematic environment, guests are free to engage as much or as little as they wish. Many hotels provide a mix of scheduled activities and always-available resources, allowing guests to customize their level of participation."
