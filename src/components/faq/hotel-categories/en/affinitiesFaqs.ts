  {
    question: "What exactly are hotel affinities?",
    answer: "Affinities are themed experiences that shape your hotel's identity — yoga, cuisine, arts, languages, digital nomad lifestyle, etc."
  },
  {
    question: "How many affinities should we offer?",
    answer: "Start with one core affinity aligned with your strengths. Later, you can add one or two complementary themes — focus creates community."
  },
  {
    question: "What affinities are most popular with guests?",
    answer: "Platform data highlights: wellness, culinary, creative arts, outdoor/nature, and digital nomad themes. Choose based on your local strengths."
  },
  {
    question: "What space requirements do affinities need?",
    answer: "Most require no renovations. Flexible community spaces, good tech, storage, and clear scheduling are enough. External partnerships are an option."
  },
  {
    question: "Can affinities change seasonally?",
    answer: "Yes. For example: hiking in summer, wellness in winter. Rotating themes works well as long as the community feeling is preserved."
  },
  {
    question: "What if some guests don't want to participate?",
    answer: "Participation is optional. Offer a mix of scheduled and on-demand activities. Guests choose their level of engagement."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should we consider affinity-based stays?",
    answer: "Because shared interests create deep connections. Guests feel at home and return. It's more than a room — it's a shared experience."
  },
  {
    question: "How does this benefit us financially?",
    answer: "Engaged guests stay longer, spend more, and come back. Community increases satisfaction — and satisfaction increases revenue."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we choose which affinities to promote?",
    answer: "Yes. Choose based on your strengths or personal passions. Especially powerful in smaller, owner-managed hotels."
  },
  {
    question: "Isn't this too specific or limiting?",
    answer: "No. Guests are seeking connection. You can rotate or combine themes. There is no \"one-size-fits-all\" — you build your identity."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the broader vision behind affinities?",
    answer: "They allow hotels to become micro-communities. In a world of isolation, shared purpose brings value beyond hospitality."
  },
  {
    question: "Does this really help fill rooms?",
    answer: "Yes. Meaningful themes turn short visits into 16- or 32-day stays. Guests stay for the place — and for the people."
  }
