    question: "What type of hotel is suitable for Hotel-Living?",
    answer: "Any kind of hotel can benefit from our program — boutique, business, resort, or urban hotels.\n\nThe only requirements are: availability for long stays, willingness to foster community, and ability to deliver consistent service."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just a seasonal opportunity?",
    answer: "Not at all. Active retirees travel year-round. Many are digital nomads, solo travelers, or couples seeking a lifestyle change.\n\nHotel-Living generates consistent demand, not just a seasonal peak."
  },
  {
    question: "How does this benefit your hotel financially?",
    answer: "It significantly increases occupancy rates, ensures stable income through longer stays, and reduces operational costs from guest turnover.\n\nProperties often improve their RevPAR and profit margins, especially in low seasons."
  },
  {
    question: "Will major changes be required to the property?",
    answer: "No. Most hotels already have what's needed.\n\nMinor adjustments like enhancing Wi-Fi or creating shared spaces may help, but no major renovations are required."
  },
  {
    question: "How can you balance your regular guests with Hotel-Living guests?",
    answer: "Our platform lets you assign specific rooms to Hotel-Living and adjust availability in real-time.\n\nMany hotels start by allocating just 10–20% of inventory and expand as demand grows."
  },
  {
    question: "Does this model reduce dependency on OTAs?",
    answer: "Yes. Hotel-Living provides direct bookings, reducing OTA commissions.\n\nOur guests book directly and often return, becoming loyal ambassadors for your property."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it help during low occupancy periods?",
    answer: "Absolutely. The model targets low-occupancy periods, filling rooms that would otherwise remain empty, with pricing that adapts to your seasonality."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the agreement with Hotel-Living protect your brand?",
    answer: "We position your property as a premium residential-style stay — not budget lodging.\n\nGuests seek authentic experiences and community, reinforcing your brand."
  },
  {
    question: "What support does Hotel-Living offer to partner hotels?",
    answer: "• Dedicated account manager\n• Staff training\n• Operational manuals\n• Marketing materials\n• Professional photography\n• Access to management dashboard"
  },
  {
    question: "When do results start appearing after joining?",
    answer: "Most hotels receive bookings within the first month.\n\nFull occupancy impact appears within 3–6 months as your property gains reputation and reviews."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this truly a new revenue strategy, not just a different type of guest?",
    answer: "Exactly. It's not just filling rooms — it's increasing value per stay: longer durations, fewer booking gaps, greater loyalty, and higher perceived value."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the financial benefits for your hotel?",
    answer: "You fill otherwise empty rooms, enjoy longer stays, less turnover, satisfied guests, and a steady, low-maintenance income stream with high repeat potential."
