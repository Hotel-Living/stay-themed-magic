    question: "If I have empty rooms, does Hotel-Living have guests for me?",

  {
    question: "What stay durations should I offer: 8, 16, 24, or 32 days?",
    answer: "Depends on hotel size:\n• Large hotels may offer all durations\n• Small hotels often start with 8-day cycles\n• Longer stays work best with space and guest volume"
  },
  {
    question: "What if the hotel has 40–60 rooms?",

  {
    question: "What approach should boutique or high-end hotels take?",
    answer: "Focus on themed 8-day programs such as:\n• Culinary weeks\n• Wellness retreats\n• Language or cultural immersions"

  {
    question: "Can I set different rates depending on the length of stay?",
    answer: "Yes, and it's encouraged. Offer progressive discounts for longer stays to increase loyalty and reduce operational costs per guest."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start with just one stay duration and expand later?",
    answer: "Yes. Many hotels begin with 8-day stays to test the model, then scale up gradually based on guest behavior and demand."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine different models within the same hotel?",
    answer: "Yes. Some rooms can be for 8-day themed cycles, others for longer stays — ideal for digital nomads or semi-retirees."
