    question: "What types of guests typically book long stays?",
    answer: "The extended-stay market includes several distinct segments: remote workers and digital nomads, active retirees exploring new lifestyles, relocation transitioners, extended vacationers, sabbatical travelers, and project-based professionals. Each segment has different needs and booking patterns, and our platform helps you attract the mix that best matches your property and affinity programs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do these guests differ from traditional hotel guests?",
    answer: "Extended-stay guests typically create deeper connections with staff, develop more structured routines, use a wider range of hotel facilities, and engage more with local communities. They often treat the hotel as a temporary home rather than just accommodation, leading to different expectations around privacy, service, and amenities."
  },
  {
    question: "What amenities do long-term guests value most?",
    answer: "Top priorities include reliable high-speed internet, comfortable workspaces, quality bedding, consistent housekeeping, laundry solutions, and communal spaces for socializing. Depending on the guest segment, additional priorities might include kitchen/dining facilities, wellness amenities, secure storage, or business services."
  },
  {
    question: "How important is community for these guests?",
    answer: "Very important for most segments, though preferences vary. Our research shows that 78% of extended-stay guests rate \"meaningful connections with others\" as a primary factor in booking decisions and satisfaction. Affinity programs create natural community bonds, even among guests who might otherwise be reserved."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we market effectively to long-stay guests?",
    answer: "The key is highlighting the lifestyle experience rather than just the accommodations. Successful marketing emphasizes the unique affinity focus, community aspects, local integration opportunities, and practical benefits of extended hotel living. Our platform provides segment-specific marketing templates and distribution to targeted extended-stay audiences."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best way to gather feedback from these guests?",
    answer: "Because relationships develop over time, informal feedback channels are often most effective. Regular check-ins from management, community gatherings, and casual conversations provide valuable insights. These should be supplemented with mid-stay formal feedback opportunities and comprehensive departure surveys focused on the extended-stay experience."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we manage guest expectations for long stays?",
    answer: "Clear communication before arrival is essential. We provide comprehensive pre-arrival information templates that outline housekeeping schedules, meal options, community activities, and local resources. Many properties also implement arrival orientations and staggered information sharing to avoid overwhelming new guests."
  },
  {
    question: "Do these guests create more management challenges?",
    answer: "Not typically. Extended-stay guests generally create fewer incidents requiring management intervention compared to short-term guests. However, they may have more detailed feedback and personalization requests as they settle in. The key is establishing clear communication channels and service boundaries from the beginning."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we handle guest mail and deliveries?",
    answer: "This is an important service for extended-stay guests. Most properties implement a dedicated system for receiving, logging, and distributing guest packages and mail. Our operations guide includes recommended protocols and tracking systems to ensure nothing gets lost, even during staff changes."
