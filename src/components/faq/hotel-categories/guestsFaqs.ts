    question: "How are guest expectations different for Hotel-Living stays?",
    answer: "Hotel-Living guests expect reliable basics (clean rooms, good internet, responsive service) but place higher value on community interactions, access to affinity activities, and spaces that facilitate their interests. They're typically more flexible on traditional luxury amenities if their core needs are met exceptionally well."

  {
    question: "Do guests interact with other hotels in the network?",

  {
    question: "How are guests matched with our property?",

Our sophisticated algorithm ensures that your hotel is shown to travelers who have expressed interest in the specific experiences your property provides, leading to higher conversion rates and more satisfied guests."
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need to facilitate guest interactions?",
    answer: "While guests naturally form connections based on shared interests, hotels can enhance this process by providing communal spaces and occasional facilitated gatherings. Some of our most successful partner properties designate community managers who help introduce guests and organize informal events."
