    question: "How do I join the Hotel-Living platform?",
    answer: "The process starts with an application through our website. After initial screening, our partnership team conducts a detailed assessment of your property. If approved, we guide you through onboarding, including affinity selection, staff training, and system integration."
  },
  {
    question: "What financial model applies to partner hotels?",
    answer: "Hotel-Living operates on a commission model based on bookings generated through our platform. We handle marketing, customer acquisition, and community building, while you focus on delivering exceptional experiences. Many properties see significant revenue increases despite the commission structure."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any implementation costs?",
    answer: "Implementation costs vary depending on your chosen affinities and existing facilities. Some affinities require minimal investment (like language or digital nomad affinities), while others might need specific equipment or space modifications. Our team works with you to identify cost-effective implementation strategies."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to implement the Hotel-Living system?",
    answer: "Typical implementation takes 4-8 weeks from approval to launch. This includes system integration, staff training, affinity setup, and marketing preparation. Properties with minimal adaptation needs can launch faster, while those requiring significant modifications might need additional time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my current property management system integrate with your platform?",
    answer: "Yes, our platform is designed to integrate with all major property management systems (PMS). We have dedicated API connections for systems like Opera, Cloudbeds, Mews, and many others. For less common PMS solutions, we offer alternative integration methods to ensure seamless operation."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support does Hotel-Living provide during and after implementation?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive support throughout the partnership. During implementation, you'll work with a dedicated onboarding manager. After launch, you'll have access to our 24/7 partner support team, regular performance reviews, ongoing training resources, and a partner community for sharing best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum commitment period for hotels?",
    answer: "Our standard agreement has a six-month initial term, which allows sufficient time to implement the system and begin seeing results. After this period, partnerships continue on a rolling three-month basis with a 30-day notice period for termination from either party."
