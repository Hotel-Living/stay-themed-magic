    question: "Can we still use our existing booking channels?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Hotel-Living works alongside your existing distribution strategy. You maintain full control over inventory allocation, allowing you to balance traditional bookings with extended stays based on your occupancy patterns and business needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the booking confirmation process like?",
    answer: "When a guest books through Hotel-Living, you receive an instant notification through email. For standard bookings, confirmation is automatic. All communication with guests happens through our messaging system until check-in."
  },
  {
    question: "How are payments processed for these bookings?",
    answer: "Guests pay a 10% deposit at booking, with the balance due directly to the hotel at check-in. This model reduces payment processing fees for hotels and minimizes cancellation risks."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we handle special requests from long-term guests?",
    answer: "All special requests are communicated through our platform's messaging system, creating a documented record. Our pre-arrival questionnaire helps identify common needs before check-in."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of reporting do we receive for Hotel-Living bookings?",
    answer: "Our comprehensive analytics dashboard provides detailed reports on booking patterns, guest demographics, revenue metrics, and affinity program engagement. You can compare performance across channels, monitor review sentiment, and track repeat booking rates. Custom reports can be scheduled for automatic delivery to key stakeholders."
  },
  {
    question: "How does this impact our existing revenue management strategy?",
    answer: "Hotel-Living enhances your revenue management capabilities by creating a reliable baseline of extended-stay bookings that can be factored into your forecasting. Many properties use our platform to strategically fill traditionally low-demand periods, allowing for more aggressive pricing during high-demand periods on conventional channels."
