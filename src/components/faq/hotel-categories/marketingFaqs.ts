    question: "Can I use the Hotel-Living partnership in my own marketing?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We encourage partners to highlight their Hotel-Living affiliation in their own marketing materials. We provide branding assets, content templates, and marketing guidelines to help you leverage the partnership effectively."

  {
    question: "How do affinities help with targeted marketing?",
    answer: "Affinities allow for precision marketing that traditional hotels cannot match. Rather than marketing to general travelers, we connect you directly with communities and individuals actively seeking the exact experiences your property offers. This targeted approach results in higher conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs."
