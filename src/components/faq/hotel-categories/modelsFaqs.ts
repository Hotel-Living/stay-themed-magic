    question: "If I have empty rooms, does Hotel-Living have clients for me?",
    answer: "There is a market for everything — and clients for every kind of offer.\n\nThe potential guest base is enormous, with people of all ages, backgrounds, and preferences looking for flexible, comfortable, and affordable alternatives to traditional housing. Whether your hotel is large or small, boutique or standard, there is a way to benefit from the Hotel Living model — and the key is adapting the offer to what works best for your property."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum number of rooms required to join Hotel Living?",
    answer: "Not at all.\nEven if your hotel has just 3 or 5 available rooms, you can still join the system.\n\nIn such cases, you might not implement thematic programs — but you can still offer 8-day stays, with:\n\nFull board,\n\nHalf board,\n\nOr just the room — depending on your setup.\n\nThe model is flexible, and there's demand for all levels of service, from simple to luxurious."
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of stay durations should my hotel offer — 8, 16, 24 or 32 days?",
    answer: "It depends on your size, category, and operational capacity.\n\nLarge hotels with enough rooms and structure often benefit from offering the full range: 8, 16, 24, and 32-day stays.\n\nSmaller hotels (e.g., with up to 20 rooms available for Hotel Living) may prefer to focus on 8-day stays, to keep things manageable and guest dynamics smooth.\n\nLonger stays are ideal when you have the space and guest volume to support them comfortably."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my hotel has around 40 to 60 available rooms?",
    answer: "That's a great mid-size range.\nYou can easily offer 8-day and 16-day stays, and expand to 24 or 32 days as your operations grow and guest demand increases."
  },
  {
    question: "What should boutique hotels or high-end properties focus on?",
    answer: "If you're a small or boutique hotel, your strength is in offering quality and uniqueness.\n\nYou can create 8-day thematic programs such as:\n\nCulinary weeks with guest chefs,\n\nWellness retreats,\n\nLanguage or cultural immersions.\n\nThese themes can repeat weekly, creating consistency and reputation while offering a rotating guest experience."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I offer different rates based on the length of stay?",
    answer: "Yes, and we highly recommend it.\nOffering progressive discounts based on stay duration helps you:\n\n- Attract longer bookings (16, 24, or 32 days),\n\n- Lower operational costs per guest\n\n- Increase loyalty and stability.\n\nGuests are naturally drawn to longer, more affordable stays — and your profitability improves."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start with only one type of stay duration and expand later?",
    answer: "Absolutely.\nMany hotels begin with 8-day stays to test the model, then gradually add longer options as operations evolve and guest habits form.\n\nYou control the pace and complexity."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine different models in the same hotel?",
    answer: "Yes, and it's often the smartest move.\nFor example:\n\n- Use some rooms for 8-day thematic cycles\n\n- Others for longer stays (ideal for digital nomads or semi-retired guests).\n\nThis approach maximizes occupancy and attracts a broader mix of clients."
