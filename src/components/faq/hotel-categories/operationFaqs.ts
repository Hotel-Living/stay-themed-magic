    question: "How do we manage day-to-day operations with extended-stay guests?",

Our system provides a dashboard for managing guest preferences, scheduled activities, and special requests."
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need specialized staff for affinity activities?",
    answer: "Some affinities may require specialized staff or facilitators, while others can be implemented with existing personnel.

  {
    question: "How is housekeeping managed for extended stays?",
    answer: "For extended stays, housekeeping is typically scheduled less frequently than for traditional short stays. Most properties offer weekly full cleaning with optional mid-week light service. This reduces labor costs while maintaining cleanliness standards. Guests appreciate the reduced intrusions during longer stays."
  },
  {
    question: "What about guest issues or conflicts during longer stays?",
    answer: "Our platform includes a centralized communication system for addressing guest concerns quickly. We also provide conflict resolution protocols specifically designed for extended-stay scenarios. Additionally, our careful guest matching and pre-screening process significantly reduces the likelihood of issues arising."
