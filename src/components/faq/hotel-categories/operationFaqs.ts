    question: "How do we manage housekeeping for long-term guests?",
    answer: "Most properties adapt their housekeeping schedule for extended stays, offering full service 1-2 times per week with simplified daily touchups (towel changes, trash removal). This balanced approach maintains cleanliness while reducing costs and respecting guest privacy. Our operational playbook provides detailed guidance on creating efficient housekeeping protocols for different stay lengths."
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need to change our check-in/check-out procedures?",
    answer: "While the basic process remains the same, we recommend creating a more comprehensive orientation for extended-stay guests, including property tours, introduction to staff, and explanation of amenities and activities."
  },
  {
    question: "What about laundry services for long-term guests?",
    answer: "Options vary by property type. Some hotels offer weekly laundry service included in the rate, others provide self-service facilities, and some offer paid laundry service. The key is creating clear, consistent policies that meet guest needs while remaining operationally efficient. As a final option, it's always possible to partner with an external laundry service â€” or simply recommend a trusted provider to your guests."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we handle meals for extended-stay guests?",
    answer: "Most hotels offer flexible meal plans that guests can customize based on their preferences and length of stay. Popular options include breakfast-only plans, half board (breakfast and dinner), and meal credit systems. Properties without restaurants often create partnerships with local delivery services or provide kitchenettes for self-catering."
  },
  {
    question: "What adaptations do our staff need to make?",
    answer: "The main adjustment is building deeper guest relationships and understanding the different service rhythms of long-term stays. Front desk staff become community facilitators, housekeepers develop personalized room preferences, and management focuses on creating a residential feeling. We provide comprehensive staff training modules for this transition."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we manage room maintenance during extended stays?",
    answer: "Preventative maintenance becomes even more important with long-term guests. We recommend scheduled mid-stay maintenance checks (with guest permission) and transparent communication about any required work. Many properties block short maintenance windows between extended stays for deeper cleaning and repairs."
  },
  {
    question: "What internet and tech requirements do long-term guests have?",
    answer: "Reliable, high-speed internet is essential, as many extended-stay guests work remotely or use streaming services extensively. We recommend dedicated bandwidth management, multiple access points for consistent coverage, and basic tech support options. Some properties also offer enhanced workspaces with business amenities."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we balance privacy with community for these guests?",
    answer: "Successful properties create clear delineations between private spaces (guest rooms) and community areas (lounges, dining spaces). Offering a mix of structured activities and spontaneous gathering opportunities allows guests to control their level of engagement. Staff training emphasizes recognizing and respecting individual guests' social preferences."
  },
  {
    question: "What special security considerations are there for long-term stays?",
    answer: "Extended-stay guests often accumulate more possessions during their stay and may be more concerned about room security. Consider enhanced in-room safes, secure storage options for valuables, and clear policies on room access during housekeeping. Many properties also implement additional verification steps during the booking process for extended stays."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the booking confirmation process like?",
    answer: "When a guest books through Hotel-Living, you receive an instant notification through email. For standard bookings, confirmation is automatic. All communication with guests happens through our messaging system until check-in."
  },
  {
    question: "How are payments processed for these extended stays?",
    answer: "Guests pay their remaining balance directly to the hotel at check-in, following standard payment procedures. This gives properties immediate access to funds without waiting for third-party processing."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we handle special requests from long-term guests?",
    answer: "Create a clear system for tracking and fulfilling guest requests, whether through your existing processes or our platform's messaging system. Many properties designate specific staff members as long-stay guest liaisons."
