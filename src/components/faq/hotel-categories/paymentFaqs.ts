    question: "What is your commission structure?",
    answer: "Our commission is just 8% of the total booking price, which is significantly lower than most online travel agencies that charge 15-25%. This competitive rate allows hotels to maintain healthy profit margins while benefiting from our specialized marketing and community-building services."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the payment process work?",
    answer: "Our payment system is designed to be hotel-friendly while providing security for guests. When a booking is made, the guest pays 10% to secure the reservation. The remaining 90% is paid directly to the hotel upon arrival, eliminating payment processing delays and reducing cancellation risks."
  },
  {
    question: "Do hotels receive any portion of the initial deposit?",
    answer: "Yes, hotels receive 2% of the total booking amount from the initial 10% deposit paid by guests. This means that for a $1,000 booking, the hotel would immediately receive $20 when the reservation is made, with the remaining $900 paid directly to the hotel at check-in."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees for hotels?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. Our 8% commission is all-inclusive, covering marketing, platform access, customer service, and payment processing. There are no additional fees, setup costs, or monthly charges. We believe in complete transparency in our partnership model."
  },
  {
    question: "How are cancellations handled financially?",
    answer: "If a guest cancels according to the property's cancellation policy, the hotel keeps the 2% already received from the initial deposit. For late cancellations that fall outside the policy terms, hotels may be entitled to a larger portion of the deposit according to their specific cancellation terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum revenue requirement to join?",
    answer: "No, we don't have minimum revenue requirements. We partner with hotels of all sizes, from boutique properties to large resorts. Our goal is to help every partner hotel optimize their occupancy and increase their revenue, regardless of their current performance."
