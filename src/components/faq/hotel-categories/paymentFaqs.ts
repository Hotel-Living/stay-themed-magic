    question: "How are bookings confirmed and processed?",
    answer: "When a guest books through Hotel-Living, they pay a 10% deposit to secure the reservation. The hotel receives immediate notification and the booking is confirmed in your system. The remaining 90% is paid by the guest directly to the hotel upon arrival, eliminating wait times for payment processing. From the 10% deposit paid by the customer during the booking proccess, you will receive a 2%-3% together with the booking communication."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods can guests use?",
    answer: "Guests can pay their initial deposit using all major credit cards, PayPal, or bank transfer. For the remaining balance paid directly to hotels, properties set their own accepted payment methods, though we recommend offering multiple options to accommodate international guests."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any additional fees beyond the commission?",
    answer: "No. Unlike many booking platforms, we don't charge listing fees, photographer fees, onboarding costs, or marketing fees. The commission is our only charge, making the partnership risk-free and directly tied to successful bookings."
