    question: "Should we offer daily activities?",
    answer: "Not at all — especially not at the beginning.\n\nHotels are not required to organize any activities, particularly in the early stages, when guest groups are still forming.\n\nWhat we recommend at the start is simply that front desk staff are prepared to recognize different types of guests (e.g., beach lovers, theatergoers, language learners) and provide basic local recommendations that match their interests.\nThis way, guests feel welcomed and supported — like they're in the right place, with people who understand their preferences.\n\nAs guest groups grow in size, hotels will naturally start to see the value of offering light, optional programming, self-guided or guest-led.\n\nEventually, when the affinity groups reach a certain scale, it may make sense to introduce group coordinators — perhaps one per 30 guests — to help facilitate and enrich the shared experience.\n\nAll of this helps create a vibrant atmosphere and encourages guest loyalty — ensuring they don't move to another hotel with similar affinities but better organized activities or stronger community leadership."
