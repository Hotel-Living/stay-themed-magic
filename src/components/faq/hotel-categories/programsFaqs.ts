    question: "What kinds of affinity programs do hotels typically offer?",
    answer: "Hotels offer programs based on their location and strengths. Popular options include culinary (cooking classes, tastings), wellness (yoga, meditation), adventure (hiking, water sports), arts (painting, music), business (coworking, networking), and cultural immersion (language exchange, local traditions). The best programs leverage your property's unique features and staff expertise."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we decide which affinity to focus on?",
    answer: "Consider your property's natural advantages (location, facilities), staff talents, guest demographics, and local resources. We provide a comprehensive consultation to help identify your optimal affinity match. Many hotels start with one core affinity and add complementary ones as their program grows."
  },
  {
    question: "What resources are needed to run successful affinity programs?",
    answer: "Most activities require minimal resources beyond what hotels already possess. The key ingredients are staff enthusiasm, dedicated space (which can be multipurpose), and consistent scheduling. We provide comprehensive activity guides, staff training resources, and connection to specialist partners if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we staff these programs? Do we need specialists?",
    answer: "While some specialized activities might require outside experts, many programs can be led by existing staff members with relevant interests or skills. Our platform connects you with local practitioners when needed, and we help identify and train internal team members who can become activity leaders."
  },
  {
    question: "What if we can't offer activities every day?",
    answer: "Consistency is important, but activities don't need to happen daily. A well-structured program might include 2-3 organized activities per week, supplemented with self-guided options, local recommendations, and community gatherings. The key is creating a reliable calendar that guests can plan around."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to implement these programs?",
    answer: "Implementation costs vary widely depending on your chosen affinities, but many successful programs start with minimal investment. The initial setup typically involves staff training, basic equipment, and marketing materials. Most hotels see positive ROI within 1-3 months through increased occupancy and higher average rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we offer multiple affinities at our property?",
    answer: "Yes, many successful properties offer 2-3 complementary affinities that appeal to their target audience. This creates a more diverse experience and attracts a wider range of guests. The key is ensuring the affinities work well together and that you have the resources to maintain quality across all programs."
  },
  {
    question: "What if some regular guests don't want to participate?",
    answer: "Participation is always optional. While the affinity creates a thematic environment, guests are free to engage as much or as little as they wish. Many hotels provide a mix of scheduled activities and always-available resources, allowing guests to customize their level of participation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we measure the success of our affinity programs?",
    answer: "Success metrics include increased occupancy rates, higher RevPAR, positive reviews mentioning the programs, repeat bookings, reduced seasonality, and increased ancillary spending. Our dashboard provides analytics specific to your affinity performance compared to general bookings."
