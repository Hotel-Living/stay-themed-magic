    question: "What are affinity stays?",
    answer: "Affinity stays are specialized hotel experiences built around particular interests or activities. By offering these experiences, you attract guests seeking specific experiences related to cuisine, language, sports, art, etc., creating a unique value proposition."
  },
  {
    question: "How do affinity group reservations work?",
    answer: "Group reservations are pre-organized stays where multiple guests with similar interests book together. Our platform coordinates these groups, filling multiple rooms at once for extended periods, guaranteeing high occupancy rates during traditional low seasons."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the long-stay program?",
    answer: "Our long-stay program focuses on extended guest reservations of one month or longer. By catering to these guests, you secure consistent occupancy while reducing turnover-related expenses and staff workload."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the multi-hotel circuit work?",
    answer: "The multi-hotel circuit allows guests to move between different affinity properties, staying in each for extended periods. By joining this network, your property becomes part of a global travel ecosystem, accessing guests who might otherwise never discover your location."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I participate in multiple affinity programs simultaneously?",
    answer: "Yes, hotels can participate in multiple affinity programs simultaneously. In fact, we encourage properties to offer 3-5 different affinities to maximize their appeal to various guest segments. Each affinity can utilize different areas of your property or operate at different times."
  },
  {
    question: "How often can affinities be changed or updated?",
    answer: "Affinities can be adjusted quarterly based on performance data and market trends. Our platform provides analytics on which affinities are generating the most bookings for your property, allowing you to optimize your offerings over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to dedicate my entire property to the Hotel-Living program?",
    answer: "No, you can start by allocating just a portion of your rooms to our program. Many partners begin with 30-50% of their inventory and gradually increase as they see the benefits. This allows you to maintain your traditional booking channels while exploring the advantages of our model."
