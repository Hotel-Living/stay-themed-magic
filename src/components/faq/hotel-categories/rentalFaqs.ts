    question: "Why have so many guests switched from hotels to rental apartments over the past years?",
    answer: "Because we, as an industry, were stuck in an outdated model. While we were giving jobs, paying staff, taxes, and creating community, rental apartments just offered lower prices and simpler platforms — and they took millions of our guests."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we still get those guests back?",
    answer: "Yes. Many of them miss what only hotels can provide: warmth, service, reliability, peace of mind, category, social reward. Rental apartments leave guests isolated, unassisted, and exposed to risks — from poor cleanliness to neighbor complaints and even safety issues."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes our hotels better equipped today to compete?",
    answer: "Hotel-Living has found our hidden treasure: our empty rooms. Up to 40% of our inventory stays vacant after break-even. That's pure potential profit we've been ignoring for years."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Hotel Living help us use that treasure?",
    answer: "By filling those long-empty rooms with longer stays and meaningful experiences — and by giving guests everything rental apartments can't:<ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1\"><li>Category and class</li><li>Full Security</li><li>Staff presence</li><li>Elegant spaces</li><li>Easy and immediacy</li><li>Convenience</li><li>A real front desk</li><li>Daily cleaning</li><li>Social atmosphere</li><li>Immediate help when needed</li><li>Zero isolation and risk</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    question: "Are rental apartment guests really missing hotels?",
    answer: "Yes — they're missing us. They miss the comfort, the care, the human presence. Many are tired of managing keys, handling problems on their own, or feeling unsafe or alone in unfamiliar apartments."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we compete on price?",
    answer: "Absolutely. These rooms are already sitting empty — almost any pricing turns them into pure revenue. And the service we provide easily justifies the difference."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the opportunity here?",
    answer: "A full recovery. We reclaim the space rental apartments have taken from us, and do it by leveraging our strengths: trust, service, community, and the unmatchable hotel experience."
