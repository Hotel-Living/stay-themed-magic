    question: "What average rate increases do partner hotels experience?",
    answer: "Partner hotels typically see average rate increases of 15-30% compared to their traditional bookings for the same room types. This premium is possible because guests value the curated experiences, community aspects, and convenience of our affinity stays."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the revenue split work?",
    answer: "Our commission is just 8% of the total price, which is significantly lower than most OTAs and booking platforms. This competitive rate allows you to maintain healthy profit margins while benefiting from our targeted marketing and consistent occupancy model."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we still use other booking channels?",
    answer: "Yes, most partner hotels maintain their existing booking channels alongside our platform. We work with you to develop an inventory allocation strategy that maximizes revenue while ensuring you can meet commitments to both traditional guests and Hotel-Living participants."
  },
  {
    question: "How predictable is the revenue from Hotel-Living bookings?",
    answer: "Very predictable. Unlike traditional bookings that fluctuate seasonally, our extended-stay and affinity programs provide consistent occupancy. Many partners can forecast their Hotel-Living revenue months in advance, allowing for better financial planning and resource allocation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we benefit from the payment structure?",
    answer: "Our payment model is designed to benefit hotels by providing both immediate income and reducing financial risks. When a guest makes a reservation, they pay 10% to secure the booking, and 2% of this amount is immediately transferred to the hotel. The remaining 90% is paid directly to the hotel upon guest arrival, eliminating middleman payment processing delays."
