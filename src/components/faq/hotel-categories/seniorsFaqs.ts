    question: "Can Hotel Living help us attract the active senior market?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Hotel Living opens the doors to a massive and growing segment: independent retirees who want comfort, services, and social life—without entering a retirement home. It's a market hotels rarely targeted… until now."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes this so different from traditional hospitality?",
    answer: "It's hospitality with a purpose. You're not just offering a room—you're offering a lifestyle. And that emotional connection creates long-term loyalty, word-of-mouth, and a whole new identity for your hotel."
  },
  {
    question: "So, many active retirees will find this long-term stays an unique possibility to boost their lifestyle?",
    answer: "Correct—and that's the beauty of it. You offer a premium experience at a fraction of the price of a retirement home, making it attractive to guests and still highly profitable for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Isn't this turning the hotel into a senior residence?",
    answer: "Not at all. We're not becoming care facilities—we're simply offering an attractive lifestyle to active seniors who want freedom, comfort, and services—without the high costs or limitations of traditional retirement homes. No medical staff, no special licenses. Just the same hotel, now serving guests who appreciate long stays and consistent services."
