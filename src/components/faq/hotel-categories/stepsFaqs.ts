    question: "Steps to join Hotel-Living",
    answer: `
<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
  <li class="font-semibold">IDENTIFY YOUR AVAILABLE ROOMS
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Start by assessing how many rooms in your hotel are usually vacant for at least 8 consecutive days (7 nights) at specific times of the year.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Of course, you don't need to convert your entire property — you can keep part of your inventory for traditional bookings, and free up other rooms for Hotel Living guests. This flexibility allows you to boost occupancy and profitability without disrupting your current operations.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="font-semibold">DEFINE AN AFFINITY-BASED CONCEPT
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Next, think of an "affinity" that could attract your best type of guest. This can be based on your hotel's location, your regular clientele, or even your own preferences as an owner.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Possibilities are endless, and some examples could include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
      <li>Nature and hiking (for mountain locations)</li>
      <li>Water sports or beach wellness (for coastal properties)</li>
      <li>Wine tasting, painting, wellness, remote work, dancing, sciences, culture, theaters, or any other subject, hobby, lifestyles, ecc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">NOTE: The affinity doesn't exclude other types of guests from booking. It's just a way to position your hotel more clearly in the market and help guests self-select their ideal environment.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="font-semibold">REGISTER AND USE THE ONLINE CALCULATOR
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Once registered, you'll gain access to our Hotel Living calculator, a powerful tool that lets you test multiple stay models (8, 16, 24, or 32 nights).</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">You'll be able to upload pricing, run financial simulations, and adjust your offers based on occupancy and revenue forecasts.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">The key goal is simple: fill your rooms — don't leave them empty.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">If you have 30 available rooms and set prices too high, you might only fill 15 — and the other 15 will remain empty, earning nothing while still costing you money or, at least, making less attractive your place as it will be half empty or not so full of life.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">But if you slightly reduce your prices, you could fill all 30 rooms — generating more revenue overall, even at a lower nightly rate and filling your hotel with life, aditional revenues and opportunities.</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">This is the same principle that, among other sectors, airlines use: they'd rather sell the last seat for $5 than let the plane take off with it empty. EVERY UNUSED SPACE IS LOST INCOME.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="font-semibold">ADD YOUR HOTEL IN YOUR DASHBOARD
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">Once your theme and pricing model are defined, go to your dashboard and complete the easy steps on "Add a new property".</p>
    <p class="font-normal mt-2">From there, you can start managing availability, visibility, and incoming long-stay bookings.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
