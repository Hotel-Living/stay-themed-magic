          <strong className="text-[#FFF9B0]">Hotel-Living</strong> is a SaaS (Software as a Service) application that creates a new market category by connecting hotels with long-term guests seeking alternative living solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
          We operate as a technology platform that facilitates extended stays, typically ranging from weeks to months, at participating hotels worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
          Our model transforms traditional short-term hospitality into a sustainable long-term living solution, creating value for both hotels (increased occupancy and revenue) and guests (flexible, service-rich accommodations).
        </p>
        <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
          By leveraging technology to match supply (empty hotel rooms) with demand (people needing flexible living arrangements), we've established an entirely new market segment worth billions.
