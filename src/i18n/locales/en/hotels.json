It just helps you position your hotel better in the market and allows guests to self-select based on their ideal environment."

On top of that, your hotel will look deserted.\\nBut if you lower prices just a bit, you could fill all 30 — generating higher total revenue, more life in your hotel, and new opportunities.\\n\\nIt's the same principle airlines use: they prefer to sell the last seat for $5 than to leave it empty.\\nEVERY EMPTY SPACE IS LOST INCOME."
