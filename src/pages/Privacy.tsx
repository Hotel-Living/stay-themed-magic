            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">For California Residents: California Legislation</h3>
            
            <p>This section supplements our Privacy Policy and will only apply to individuals residing in California. It describes how we use and process your personal data ("personal information" is the original term used by the law) and explains your specific rights.</p>
            
            <p>Below we describe the categories of personal information we collect about you:</p>
            <ol className="list-alpha pl-6 space-y-1">

            </ol>
            
            <p>We may share some of your personal data with third parties, which may be considered a "sale" of data under California laws. This may include data relating to identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, internet activity, and inferences, as described above. We may also share the personal data indicated above in sections A-I for "business purposes," such as sharing with service providers who help us ensure our services, for payment purposes, customer service, marketing message delivery, or advertising.</p>
            
            <p>California legislation gives you certain rights, including: accessing some personal data; knowing how we process personal data, including transmission or sale of such data; requesting deletion of personal data; rejecting "sales"; and not being denied any product or service for exercising these rights.</p>
            
            <p>If you are an authorized agent wishing to exercise rights on behalf of a California customer, contact us via the email above attaching a written authorization from the customer designating you as their agent. We may need to verify your identity before processing your rights request, for example, by asking you for information about your previous Travel Bookings with us.</p>
            
            <p>Hotel-Living.com services are not directed at individuals under 16 years of age. Therefore, Hotel-Living.com does not intentionally sell personal data of minors under 16 years without proper consent, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
            
            <p>"Sensitive personal information" is any information that, if leaked or used illegally, could easily result in a breach of rights relating to human dignity or cause harm to an individual or their property. When using Hotel-Living.com services, it is possible that Hotel-Living.com or an external provider may collect the following sensitive personal information from you:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

              <li>Location information, for the purpose of showing you city guides, recommending accommodations and attractions closest to your current location, or offering other recommendations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Please note that, when using our services, the type of accommodation you search for may reveal sensitive information about your sexual orientation. Similarly, dietary preferences you indicate when booking a flight may also reveal sensitive information about your religion and health.</p>
            
            <p>We will ask for your consent before collecting sensitive personal information. However, when you voluntarily provide sensitive personal information, we will assume that you have given us your consent to process that information within the context in which it was submitted.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">International Transfer and Recipients of Personal Information</h3>
            
            <p>In order to provide you with our services, we will share your personal information with third parties. In many cases, your personal information may be transferred and stored outside China to send the data to these third parties. We will ask for your consent before making such a transfer. The reasons for the transfer, as well as the categories of recipients of this personal information, are indicated below.</p>
            
            <p>To complete your Travel Booking, we transfer the corresponding booking data to the Travel Provider you have booked. This is one of the essential things we do. Depending on the Travel Booking and the Travel Provider, the personal information we transfer may include your name, contact details, payment data, the names of people traveling with you, and any preferences or other information you have indicated when making the Travel Booking.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Automated Decision Making</h3>
            
            <p>Automated decision making refers to the activity of using computer programs to analyze, evaluate or make decisions automatically about the following: personal behaviors, habits, interests, hobbies, finances, health, credit or other status.</p>
            
            <p>We rely on personal information to make automated decisions, such as offering you the best price, depending on where you are located. When you search our apps or website, for example, to find accommodation, a rental car, or a flight, we process your IP address to confirm whether you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in another country. We do this to offer you the best price based on the region (EEA) or the country (outside the EEA). This processing does not result in differential treatment of people in China.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Cookie Policy</h2>
            
            <p>Whenever you use our online services or apps, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (which we'll refer to as "cookies" for the purposes of this Cookie Policy).</p>
            
            <p>Cookies can be used in different ways, for example, to make the Hotel-Living.com website work, to analyze traffic, or for advertising purposes.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">What are cookies and other online tracking technologies?</h3>
            
            <p>A web browser cookie is a small text file that websites place in your web browser or mobile device. These cookies store information about the content you view and interact with, in order to remember your preferences and settings or analyze your use of online services.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies are divided into "first-party" cookies and "third-party" cookies:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>First-party cookies are those enabled by the domain owner, in our case, Hotel-Living.com. Any cookie that we place is a "first-party cookie".</li>
              <li>Third-party cookies are those placed on our domains by trusted partners to whom we have given permission to do so. These may be social network partners, advertising partners, security providers, and others.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There is also a distinction between "session cookies" and "persistent cookies":</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Session cookies will only remain active until you close your browser and end your "session". They are then deleted.</li>
              <li>The lifespan of persistent cookies varies, and they remain on your device when you close your browser. On the Hotel-Living.com platform, we try to use only persistent cookies (or allow third-party persistent cookies) with a limited lifespan. However, for security reasons or in exceptional circumstances, a cookie may have a longer lifespan.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Web browser cookies store information such as your IP address, another identifier or browser type, as well as information about the content you view and interact with when using digital services. By storing this information, web browser cookies remember your preferences and settings for online services and analyze how you use them.</p>
            
            <p>Along with cookies, we also use very similar tracking technologies. Our website, emails, and mobile apps may contain lines of code or small transparent image files that record how you interact with them. These include "web beacons", "scripts", "tracking URLs" or "software development kits" (SDKs).</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Web beacons have many different names. They are also called web bugs, tracking bugs, tags, web tags, page tags, tracking pixels, pixel tags, 1×1 GIFs, or transparent GIFs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In summary, a web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be sent to your computer as part of a web page request, in an app, in an advertisement, or in an HTML email message. They can be used to retrieve information from your device, such as device type and operating system, IP address, and time of visit. They are also used to run and read cookies in your browser or to place a cookie.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Scripts are small computer programs embedded in web pages that give those pages a wide variety of additional functionalities. Scripts serve to make the website work correctly. For example, they activate certain security features and enable basic interactive features on our website.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Scripts can also be used for advertising or analytical purposes. For example, a script can collect information about how you use our website, such as the pages you visit or what you search for.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Tracking URLs are links with a unique identifier. They are used to know from which website you have accessed the Hotel-Living.com websites and apps. For example, if you click from a social network, a search engine, or a website of one of our affiliates.</li>
              <li>Software development kits (SDKs) are part of the source code of our apps and, unlike browser cookies, SDK data is stored in the app.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>They serve to analyze how apps are used or to send personalized push notifications. To do this, they record unique identifiers associated with your device, such as IP address or device ID, as well as app activity and your network location.</p>
            
            <p>All of these tracking technologies are referred to as "cookies" in this Cookie Policy.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">How are cookies used?</h3>
            
            <p>Cookies are used to collect information, for example:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>IP address</li>
              <li>Device ID</li>
              <li>Pages viewed</li>
              <li>Browser type</li>
              <li>Browsing information</li>
              <li>Operating system</li>
              <li>Internet service provider</li>
              <li>Time log</li>
              <li>Information about whether you have responded to an advertisement</li>
              <li>Referral URL</li>
              <li>Features used or activities performed on the website and/or apps</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>They allow you to be recognized as the same user, across pages of the same website, between different devices and web pages, or when you use an app. With regard to their purpose, they can be divided into three categories: functional, analytical, and marketing cookies.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Functional cookies</h4>
            
            <p>These are cookies necessary for the functioning of our websites and apps, and must be enabled for you to use our services.</p>
            
            <p>Functional cookies serve to create user-friendly and technically advanced websites and apps that automatically adapt to your needs and preferences, so you can easily navigate and book.</p>
            
            <p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Allow our website and apps to work correctly, so you can create an account, log in, and manage your bookings.</li>
              <li>Remember the language and currency you have selected, your previous searches, and other preferences to help you use our website and apps efficiently and effectively.</li>
              <li>Remember your registration data so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our website or app. (Don't worry: passwords will always be encrypted).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Analytical cookies</h4>
            
            <p>These cookies measure and track how our website and apps are used. We use this information to improve our website, apps, and services.</p>
            
            <p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Marketing cookies</h4>
            
            <p>Hotel-Living.com and our trusted partners use these cookies to collect information about you over time, across different websites, apps, and other platforms.</p>
            
            <p>Marketing cookies help us decide which products, services, and interest-based ads to show you, both on and off our website and apps.</p>
            
            <p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Classify you by assigning you an interest profile, for example, based on the websites you visit and the clicks you make. We use these profiles to display personalized content (such as travel ideas or specific accommodations) on Hotel-Living.com and other websites.</li>
              <li>Display personalized content and interest-based ads on the Hotel-Living.com website, in our apps, and on other websites. This is called "retargeting" and is based on browsing activities, such as the destinations you have been searching for, the accommodations you have viewed, and the prices that have been shown to you. It can also be based on your shopping habits or other online activities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Retargeting ads may be shown to you before or after you leave Hotel-Living.com, as their aim is to encourage you to browse our website or return to it. You may see these ads on websites, apps, or emails.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Integrate social networks into our website and apps. This allows you to "like" or share content on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, and LinkedIn.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These "Like" and "Share" buttons work with pieces of code from the various social network providers and allow third-party cookies to be activated on your device.</p>
            
            <p>These cookies may be purely functional, but they can also be used to track the websites you visit from their network, create a profile of your online browsing behavior, and show you personalized ads. This profile will be built in part with comparable information they receive from your visits to other websites in their network.</p>
            
            <p>If you want more information about what social network providers do with your personal data, check their privacy or cookie policies: Facebook (includes Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network), Snapchat, Pinterest, and Twitter. Remember that these policies may be updated from time to time.</p>
            
            <p>We collaborate with trusted third parties to collect data. Sometimes we also share information with these third parties, such as your email address or mobile number. These third parties may link your data with other information they collect to target their audience or send specific ads. If you want more information about how these third parties process your data, check these links: How Google uses information, Facebook Data Policy.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Techniques other than cookies: email pixels</h3>
            
            <p>We may also use techniques, such as pixels, which we do not consider cookies because they do not store information on your device.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes, we add pixels to emails, for example, to newsletters. A "pixel" is an electronic file the size of a single pixel that is integrated into the email and loads when you open it. By using email pixels, we can know if the email was delivered, if you read it and when, and where you click.</p>
            
            <p>We also receive this information about the push notifications we send you. These statistics give us information about your reading behavior, which we then use to optimize our messages and make our communications more relevant to you.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">What are your options?</h3>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Analysis<br />To prevent Google Analytics from collecting data for analytical purposes in some types of browsers, follow this link: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (for computers only).</li>
              <li>Advertising<br />We always seek to partner with marketing and advertising companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>NAI and IAB members adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct and also allow you to opt out of behavioral advertising.</p>
            
            <p>Go to www.networkadvertising.org to identify NAI members that may have stored cookies on your computer. To opt out of a behavioral advertising program from an NAI member, simply check the box for that company.</p>
            
            <p>You may also want to visit www.youronlinechoices.com or www.youradchoices.com to learn how to opt out of personalized ads.</p>
            
            <p>In your mobile device settings, you may be able to limit the information that is shared for retargeting purposes. If you choose to do this, please note that opting out of the online ad network does not mean you will stop seeing or being the target of online ads or marketing analysis. It only means that the network you have opted out of will no longer send you personalized ads based on your preferences and browsing patterns.</p>
            
            <p>Some websites offer the "Do Not Accept Cookies" option, which allows you to prevent tracking. Currently, we do not have the "Do Not Accept Cookies" option in browser settings.</p>
