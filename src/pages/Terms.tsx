                We take reasonable precautions when offering our Platform, but we cannot guarantee that all content is accurate (we obtain information from Service Providers).

                You may need to create an Account to make a Reservation. Make sure all information (including payment and contact details) is correct and up to date, or you may not be able to access your Travel Experiences. You are solely responsible for everything that happens with your Account, so you should prevent anyone else from using it and keep your username and password secret.

              <p className="mb-4">
                When you make a Reservation, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience, including all applicable charges and taxes.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Some of the prices you see may have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The price you pay will be based on the original price, not the rounded one (although the actual difference between the two will be minimal).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Obvious errors and typos are not binding. For example, if you book a luxury car or a night in a luxury suite that was erroneously offered for â‚¬1, we can simply cancel the Reservation and refund any amount you have paid.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                A crossed-out price indicates the price of an equivalent Reservation without the applied price reduction ("equivalent" means same dates, same conditions, same quality of accommodation/car/travel class, etc.).

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-4 text-[#efe6ef]">PAYMENT</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We are responsible for charging you a non-refundable deposit for your reservation. We (or, sometimes, our affiliate in the country of origin of the payment) will be responsible for managing the payment and ensuring that the transaction with the Service Provider is completed.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If the currency selected on the Platform is not the same as that of the Service Provider, we may:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>display prices in the currency you choose;</li>

              <p className="mb-4">
                You can see our Currency Exchange Rate during the payment process, in your Reservation information from your Account or, if you don't have an Account, in the email we have sent you. If we charge you any fee in relation to any of these services, you will find such fee expressed as a percentage over the European Central Bank rates. Your card issuer might charge you a foreign transaction fee.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We will store your Payment Method data for future transactions once you have given us your consent to do so.

              <p className="mb-4">
                When you make a Reservation, you are accepting the applicable conditions shown during the booking process. You will find the Service Providers' cancellation conditions, as well as any other conditions (age requirements, damage/security deposits, additional supplements for group Reservations, extra beds, breakfast, pets, accepted cards, etc.), on our Platform: on the Service Provider's information page, during the booking process, in the "Please note" section and/or in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you cancel a Reservation or do not show up, cancellation or no-show charges, as well as any refund, will depend on the Service Provider's cancellation and no-show conditions.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Some Reservations cannot be canceled for free, while others can only be canceled for free before a specific deadline.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you think you won't arrive on time, contact the Service Provider and tell them when you will be able to arrive, so they don't cancel the Reservation. If you arrive late, we will not be responsible for the consequences such as, for example, the cancellation of the Reservation or any charge that the Service Provider may charge you.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As the person making the Reservation, you are responsible for the actions and behavior (in relation to the Travel Experience) of each person in your group. You are also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.
